# React Dashboard

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and includes `tailwindcss` and `react-router-dom`. All code is written in **TypeScript**.

## Available Scripts

The app starts with a login page. You can sign in with Google or choose **Admin** or **User** directly to navigate to the respective dashboard. To enable Google sign-in provide `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` in an `.env` file.
