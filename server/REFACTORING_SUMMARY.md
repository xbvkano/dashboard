# Server Refactoring Summary

## Overview
The server has been refactored to improve code organization and fix the appointment block height issue for AI-created appointments.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Appointment Block Height Issue
- **Problem**: AI-created appointments had very small blocks in the daily view because they were missing the `hours` field
- **Solution**: 
  - Created `calculateAppointmentHours()` function in `utils/appointmentUtils.ts`
  - Updated AI appointment creation to include calculated hours based on size and service type
  - Hours calculation logic:
    - Base hours: 3-9 hours based on square footage
    - DEEP cleaning: +1 hour
    - MOVE_IN_OUT cleaning: +2 hours

### 2. Server Structure Refactoring

#### Created New Directory Structure:
```
server/src/
├── controllers/
│   ├── aiAppointmentsController.ts
│   └── openApiController.ts
├── routes/
│   └── aiAppointments.ts
├── utils/
│   └── appointmentUtils.ts
└── server.ts (simplified)
```

#### New Files Created:

**`utils/appointmentUtils.ts`**
- `parseSqft()` - Parse square footage from size string
- `calculateAppointmentHours()` - Calculate appointment duration based on size and service type
- `calculatePayRate()` - Calculate employee pay rates
- `calculateCarpetRate()` - Calculate carpet cleaning rates

**`controllers/aiAppointmentsController.ts`**
- `createAIAppointment()` - Handle AI appointment creation with hours calculation
- `getAIAppointments()` - Fetch AI-created appointments

**`controllers/openApiController.ts`**
- `getOpenAPISpec()` - Serve OpenAPI specification for AI endpoints

**`routes/aiAppointments.ts`**
- Routes for AI appointment endpoints
- OpenAPI specification endpoint

#### Refactored `server.ts`:
- Removed large AI appointment endpoint code
- Removed OpenAPI specification endpoint
- Added imports for utility functions and routes
- Cleaner, more maintainable structure

### 3. Benefits of Refactoring

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each controller handles specific functionality
2. **Reusability**: Utility functions can be used across different parts of the application
3. **Maintainability**: Easier to find and modify specific functionality
4. **Testability**: Individual functions can be tested in isolation
5. **Scalability**: Easy to add new controllers and routes

### 4. Hours Calculation Logic

The appointment hours are now calculated based on:
- **Size**: 1500-2000 sqft = 4 hours, 2000-2500 sqft = 5 hours, etc.
- **Service Type**: 
  - STANDARD: Base hours
  - DEEP: Base hours + 1
  - MOVE_IN_OUT: Base hours + 2

### 5. API Endpoints

The following endpoints are now properly organized:
- `POST /ai-appointments` - Create AI appointments with proper hours
- `GET /appointments/ai` - Fetch AI-created appointments
- `GET /openapi.json` - OpenAPI specification

## Testing

The refactored code has been tested and confirmed to work correctly:
- AI appointments now include the `hours` field
- Appointment blocks in the daily view will display with proper height
- All existing functionality remains intact
- Server starts without errors

## Next Steps

The server is now ready for further development with a clean, organized structure that makes it easy to:
- Add new controllers for other functionality
- Create new utility functions
- Add new routes
- Maintain and debug existing code
